## Powerball simulation

In p\Powerball, choose 5 numbers from 1 to 69 without replacement, then choose one number from 1 to 26.

What is the distribution of the sum of all six numbers?

```{r}
powerSum <- function(){
  x = c(sample(69, 5), sample(26, 1))
  return(sum(x))
}
```

```{r}
simSums = replicate(10000, powerSum())
```

```{r}
hist(simSums)
```
How often did we get a sum <= 106?

```{r}
mean(simSums <= 106)
```
